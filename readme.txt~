The following plugin allows for several different rss feed uploads.  It takes in the formatted xml's and converts them into a custom post type to keep
things clean.  There are several options in the work which will include full-content (currently experimental) as well as several options to see what
will be posted for cleaner feed posts.

The current options are available for showing the feeds:
1) shortcode [feed_info] and [feed_search] which will allow for searching and displaying based upon feed information and category information.
2) full-content and updated feed content.
3) custom feed names and custom feed categories which work in conjunction with already created categories in your wordpress sytem
